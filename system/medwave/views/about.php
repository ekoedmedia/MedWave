					<a name="uploading"></a>
					<div class="margin-top:50px;"></div>
					<h3>Uploading</h3>
					<p>

					<div class="margin-top:50px;"></div>
					<h3>Search</h3>
					<p>

					</p>
					<img src="https://raw.github.com/ekoedmedia/MedWave/master/media/report-img/16.png">
					<p>
						Finally, Records are displayed ONLY to the pertaining user that is logged in. So patients will only see their records, Doctors will only see their Patients records, Radiologists will only see the records they have added, and Administrators are able to see all records.
					</p>
					
					<a name="analysis"></a>
					<div class="margin-top:50px;"></div>
					<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
					<p>
						On the Data Analysis Module page, Administrators are able to see the image count depending on what parameters are set. The image count is based on a summation of data for each record in the database.
					</p>
					<p>
						For filtering options, the Administrator is able to select individual Patients and/or Test Types, or they can select all of them or none of them. 
					</p>
					<img src="https://raw.github.com/ekoedmedia/MedWave/master/media/report-img/18.png">
					<p>
						They are also able to filter with Time Range. The Time Range option allows the admins to see a range of data from a date, up to a date, or between two dates. Including a Time Range also includes the Roll Up and Drill Down functionality. By default, it is set to the highest level which is Year. From here you are able to Drill Down to Month and Week.
